Deployment Strategy: PII Detector & Redactor
Recommended Location: API Gateway Plugin
Why at the API Gateway?

All data going in and out of the backend passes through the API gateway.

By adding the PII redaction as a plugin here, you protect all downstream services without changing each service’s code.

Fast and centralized: One place to update, easy to test.

How will it work?
The PII detection script (Python) is wrapped as a plugin or microservice for your API gateway (such as NGINX, Kong, or Express middleware).

When new data (like API requests or logs) comes in, the gateway sends it to the plugin.

The plugin scans and redacts any detected PII before allowing the data through.

This works for both incoming requests from customers and outgoing data to users or logs.

Deployment Steps
Integrate the plugin:
Copy your Python detector script and set it up to run as a module at your API gateway.

Configure the gateway:
Update gateway config to route all traffic through the plugin before reaching backend.

Testing:
Run test requests and verify that PII is detected and masked in the output.

Monitor:
Add basic logging to the plugin for any PII found and redacted (helpful for audits).

Pros
Scalable: Handles high traffic since API gateways are built for performance.

Low Latency: Code runs quickly, so delays are minimal for users.

Cost-Effective: No need to change every backend system.

Easy Integration: Just add one module/plugin; updates are simple.

Cons
If some data bypasses the API gateway (like direct DB access), it won’t be protected.

Internal audits might still be needed for legacy systems.

Summary:
Deploy your PII Detector & Redactor as an API gateway plugin for centralized, low-latency data protection. This keeps your solution simple, robust, and easy to manage. Add internal scanning only if needed later.
